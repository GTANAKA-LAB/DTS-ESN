# DTS-ESN
The echo state network (ESN) is a special recurrent neural network model proposed by H.Jaeger in 2001, which is currently a representative model of reservoir computing.
The DTS-ESN ([Tanaka et al., arXiv:2108.09446][https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09446]) is an extended ESNã€€model with diverse timescales for prediction of multiscale dynamics.
