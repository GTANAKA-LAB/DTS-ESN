# DTS-ESN
The echo state network (ESN) is a special recurrent neural network model proposed by H. Jaeger in 2001, which is a representative model for reservoir computing.
The DTS-ESN ([Tanaka et al., arXiv:2108.09446](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09446)) is an extended ESNmodel with diverse timescales for prediction of multiscale dynamics.
