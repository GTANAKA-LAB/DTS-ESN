# 1step_ahead_prediction
In [Tanaka et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 2022](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.L032014)), two tasks are performed using the DTS-ESN. The first task is a one-step-ahead prediction with the open-loop DTS-ESN (see Fig.1(b)). The example here gives a code and a demo for reproducing Fig.S2(e), where the dynamics of the whole two-coupled Lorenz model is predicted only from its fast dynamics.
